With a campus of almost 90 acres, WCE hosts over 5k people, 15+ mega-events every year, 10+ clubs, and 5+ famous spots. The use of social media alone can't suffice for managing and updating them.
We have found a solution to this with our website "Up-To-Date WCE", which will provide you with the latest WCE information.
Upon scanning the QR code, you will be redirected to the website.

The updates given by faculties related to academics, exams, rescheduling of lectures, and available free slots for extra-lectures, every update will be here. As each faculty will have the option to reserve that particular slot for extra lectures there will be no confusion between faculties about when to conduct lectures.
There are often clashes between club meetings because the time and the location are the same. Therefore, you will be able to reserve a particular place at that time slot through the pre-update of the time and location feature. Here you'll find all the latest club news.
As stated before, WCE is an expansive campus. For a new person, it's a bit difficult to find a place, so Up-To-Date WCE has a feature called “WCE Maps”, which will help one to find a particular place.

Adding to this even it takes long walks and time to go to canteens like Sagar and Lipton, and if they are closed. Now, there is no need to go to canteens like Sagar and Lipton and find out if they are open, with our new feature WCE Fantasy you can just refresh the website, and you will know the present state and everything at WCE.
